Instructions

During this weekend we plan on creating a headless CRUD application based on the project you proposed.

The requirements are:

1- A data-driven application.

2- Your application has a document and a sub-document (or an array of sub-documents).

3- Perform CRUD operations on the application's main documents.

4- Perform CRUD operations on the application's main sub-documents.

5- Make sure you use the proper URL paths and methods to perform CRUD operations as discussed in class.

6- Your application must have API hardening.

This application is due by Sunday night, Make sure you are awake with us on Monday. We are starting Angular and UI, it will require you to focus. Angular is going to be used in the programming exam.
